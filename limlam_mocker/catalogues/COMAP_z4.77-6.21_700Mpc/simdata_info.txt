Some notes from his email:
- "midz" simulation: 20GHz to 16GHz
- sim covers from 20GHz to 16GHz in a 700Mpc box
- each of the 18 sims cover 4.72 x 4.72 deg for 72 non-overlapping 4sq deg patches
- uses Li cosmological parameters, and have a minimum halo mass off 4e9 Msun (not Msunh)
- files are in the .npz format and should read in to limlam_mocker
- the halos range from 7764 to 8464 cMpc
